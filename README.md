# MCP Workflow System

An intelligent workflow system leveraging Model Context Protocol (MCP) for knowledge graph building and contextual understanding in agent-based interactions.

## Project Overview

The MCP Workflow System creates a comprehensive framework for:
- Processing messages and extracting meaningful entities
- Building and maintaining a knowledge graph
- Determining user intent and context
- Generating contextual, knowledge-enhanced responses

This system is designed to serve as a foundation for agent-based AI applications that require persistent memory and contextual understanding.

## Current Status

The project is in active development, with progress in several key areas:

- âœ… **Entity Extraction**: Base framework and initial implementation completed
- ðŸ”„ **Knowledge Graph Schema**: Design completed, implementation in progress
- ðŸ”„ **Architecture Design**: Detailed specification completed, implementation in progress
- ðŸ“… **Intent Determination**: Planned for future implementation
- ðŸ“… **Strategy Execution**: Planned for future implementation
- ðŸ“… **Response Generation**: Planned for future implementation

For a detailed overview of the project's current status, please see [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md).

## Core Components

### 1. Entity Extraction
```
ExtractEntities(Named, Technical, Conceptual)
  -> IdentifyNamedEntities(People, Organizations, Technologies)
  -> RecognizeTechnicalTerms(Code, Frameworks, Architecture)
  -> ExtractConceptualElements(Ideas, Goals, Problems)
  -> AssignConfidenceScores(Entities)
  -> DetermineRelationships(EntityPairs)
  -> StructureEntityCollection(Hierarchy)
```

The Entity Extraction module identifies and classifies entities from text. It supports:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Technical term extraction
- Conceptual element identification
- Relationship extraction
- Confidence scoring

### 2. Knowledge Mapping
```
MapToKnowledge(Entities, Relations)
  -> ResolveEntityIdentities(Matching, Disambiguation)
  -> FindExistingRelations(DirectConnections, PathConnections)
  -> IdentifyKnowledgeGaps(MissingEntities, UncertainRelations)
  -> ScoreRelevance(EntityImportance, RelationStrength)
  -> GenerateKnowledgeQueries(Clarification, Expansion)
  -> CreateKnowledgeUpdatePlan(Additions, Modifications)
```

The Knowledge Mapping component connects extracted entities to the knowledge graph.

### 3. Intent Determination
```
DetermineIntent(Primary, Secondary, Context)
  -> ClassifyIntentType(Query, Command, Statement, Discussion)
  -> ExtractIntentParameters(Entities, Constraints, Preferences)
  -> AssessContextualFactors(History, State, Environment)
  -> PrioritizeIntents(Primary, Secondary, Implied)
  -> FormulateIntentRepresentation(Structured, Actionable)
```

The Intent Determination module identifies the user's intentions from messages.

### 4. Strategy Execution
```
ExecuteStrategy(Actions, Computations, Searches)
  -> PlanExecution(Dependencies, Parallelism, Sequencing)
  -> PerformKnowledgeOperations(Retrieval, Inference, Validation)
  -> ExecuteComputationalTasks(Analysis, Transformation, Generation)
  -> AccessExternalResources(APIs, Files, Databases)
  -> HandleExceptions(Errors, Timeouts, Limitations)
  -> CollectExecutionResults(Outputs, Metrics, Logs)
```

The Strategy Execution component executes operations based on the identified intent.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omar-el-mountassir/mcp-workflow-system.git
cd mcp-workflow-system
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the spaCy-based entity extractor, you'll need to download the language model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Running Examples

Try out the entity extraction demo:
```bash
python examples/entity_extraction_demo.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```
