# MCP Workflow System - Project Status

## Current Status

**Date**: April 3, 2025  
**Status**: Active Development - Phase 1  
**Repository**: [github.com/omar-el-mountassir/mcp-workflow-system](https://github.com/omar-el-mountassir/mcp-workflow-system)

## Project Overview

The MCP Workflow System is an intelligent workflow for processing messages, extracting entities, building a knowledge graph, and generating contextual responses using Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. The system serves as a foundation for agent-based AI applications that require persistent memory and contextual understanding.

## Key Components

### Entity Extraction

The entity extraction module identifies and classifies entities from text. It includes:

- **Base framework** - Core classes for entities, relationships, and extractors
- **Rule-based extractor** - Simple pattern matching for entity extraction
- **spaCy extractor** - NLP-based entity and relationship extraction
- **Composite extractor** - Combines multiple extraction methods

### Knowledge Graph (Planned)

The knowledge graph will store entities and relationships with:

- **Structured schema** - Clearly defined entity and relationship types
- **Confidence scoring** - Metrics for information reliability
- **Temporal tracking** - Observation history and updates
- **Query interface** - Methods for retrieving and analyzing knowledge

### Intent Determination (Planned)

Will classify message intents and extract parameters:

- **Intent classification** - Categorization of message purpose
- **Parameter extraction** - Identification of relevant entities and constraints
- **Context assessment** - Consideration of conversation history and state
- **Priority ordering** - Handling of multiple intents

### Workflow Orchestration (Planned)

Will integrate all components:

- **Message processing** - Initial parsing and metadata extraction
- **Pipeline management** - Sequencing of operations
- **Strategy execution** - Running the appropriate actions for intents
- **Response generation** - Creating contextual, knowledge-enhanced responses

## Technical Stack

- **Core Language**: Python 3.10+
- **NLP Library**: spaCy
- **Graph Database** (planned): Neo4j
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - NetworkX for graph operations
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - Transformers (planned) for advanced NLP

## Next Milestone Goals

1. Complete the entity extraction module with enhanced capabilities
2. Implement the knowledge graph with basic CRUD operations
3. Create the intent determination module
4. Develop a simple end-to-end workflow for basic operations
5. Create integration tests for the complete system

## Development Schedule

- **April 2025**: Complete entity extraction module and knowledge graph implementation
- **May 2025**: Implement intent determination and basic workflow orchestration
- **June 2025**: Develop response generation and integration testing
- **July 2025**: Performance optimization and documentation

## Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Entity extraction accuracy | Composite approach with multiple extraction methods |
| Knowledge graph complexity | Comprehensive schema with clear validation rules |
| Component integration | Well-defined interfaces and extensive testing |
| Performance at scale | Progressive optimization and profiling |

## Resource Requirements

- **Development**: Python expertise, NLP knowledge, graph database experience
- **Testing**: Test frameworks, sample datasets
- **Deployment** (future): Containerization, scaling infrastructure

## Conclusion

The MCP Workflow System is making good progress, with a solid foundation in place for the entity extraction module. The architecture and detailed planning provide a clear path forward for implementing the remaining components. The modular design ensures that each component can be developed and tested independently before integration into the complete workflow system.
