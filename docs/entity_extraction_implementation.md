# Entity Extraction Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

The Entity Extraction component is responsible for identifying and classifying entities from processed messages. This document outlines the implementation plan for this critical component.

## 2. Extraction Categories

### 2.1. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition focuses on identifying named entities such as people, organizations, locations, and other proper nouns.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Use spaCy as the primary NER framework
- Train custom NER models for domain-specific entities
- Implement rule-based recognition for specific patterns
- Leverage pretrained transformer models for improved accuracy

**Key Metrics**:
- Precision: Percentage of identified entities that are correct
- Recall: Percentage of actual entities that are identified
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### 2.2. Technical Term Extraction

Technical Term Extraction focuses on identifying domain-specific technical terms, including programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technical concepts.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create custom gazetteer lists for common technical terms
- Use domain-specific word embeddings
- Implement pattern matching for code snippets
- Apply term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for relevance

**Key Metrics**:
- Domain coverage: Percentage of known technical terms identified
- Contextual accuracy: Correct identification of term meaning in context

### 2.3. Conceptual Element Extraction

Conceptual Element Extraction focuses on identifying abstract concepts, ideas, goals, problems, and other non-concrete entities.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Use transformer-based semantic understanding
- Implement frame semantics analysis
- Apply ontology-guided extraction
- Leverage topic modeling techniques

**Key Metrics**:
- Concept relevance: Relevance of extracted concepts to the domain
- Abstraction accuracy: Correct classification of abstraction level

### 2.4. Relationship Extraction

Relationship Extraction focuses on identifying connections between entities.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Implement dependency parsing for syntactic relationships
- Use co-occurrence analysis for associative relationships
- Apply distant supervision for relationship classification
- Implement coreference resolution for entity linking

**Key Metrics**:
- Relationship precision: Percentage of identified relationships that are correct
- Relationship recall: Percentage of actual relationships that are identified
- Linking accuracy: Correct resolution of entity references

    Args:
        base_score (float): Base confidence from the extraction model
        context_factor (float): Factor based on context clarity

    Returns:
        float: Final confidence score between 0 and 1
    """
    confidence = base_score * context_factor * (1 + 0.2 * frequency_factor)
    confidence = confidence * (0.8 + 0.2 * method_agreement)
    return min(1.0, max(0.0, confidence))
